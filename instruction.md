* **Dataset**: Davis (comes with R in the "car" package)
<br>  
* The app below let's you apply different transformations on the variable weight in the "Davis"-dataset.
<br>  
* Transformations are mathematical operations executed on the values of every single unit i.e. observation in the sample.
<br>  
* Transformations
    + Centering ...by substracting the mean of the variable.
    + Set minimum to 0 ... by substracting the minimum of the variable.
    + Rescaling ...by multiplying or dividing by some number to change units of the scale/variable
    + Reversing ...by substracting the maximum of the variable and taking the absolute value
    + Standardizing using z-Scores ...by substracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
